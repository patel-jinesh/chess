# Chess Duplicate

This is an attempt by me to create a duplicate of chess.com. The purpose of this is exercise is to learn various subjects in software such as the software development lifecycle, software architecture, devops, scalability, security, and overall just have fun doing this project which putting my skills to the test and enchanching them at the same time. 

The project will be accomplished through:
1. Identify and analyze the major features in chess.com
    * Only features that seem necessary to chess.com, interesting, and plausible to implement for a single individual will be chosen.
2. Come up with simple requirements, without too much detail to keep the scope of the project open from the analysis.
3. Come up with a generic, loose software architecture to implement said features.
5. Figure out the tech stack that will be used to implement the project.
4. Code :)
5. Refactor!!
6. See what could have been done better.
